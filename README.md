A function is a subprogram designed to perform a specific task. It encapsulates a block of code that can be executed multiple times.
Invocation: A function is executed only when it is called or invoked. It won't run automatically when the script loads unless explicitly called.
Parameters: Functions can accept input values called parameters. These parameters are placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it's called.
Parameters are optional and can be omitted if the function doesn't require any input.
Return Value: Functions can produce a result, known as the return value. This is the output of the function after performing its task. 
If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns undefined.

Object: In JavaScript, functions are considered first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. 
This also means that functions have properties and methods like any other object in JavaScript.
Function Declaration: A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), 
and the block of statements enclosed in curly braces {}. 

Here's an example:
function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // Function statements
    console.log(parameter1 + parameter2);
}



NOTES SUMMARY FOR JAVASCRUPT 
JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions.
Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information
You can use Javascript to add dynamic behavior, store information, and handle requests and responses on a website
The Document Object Model is an Application Programming Interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.

It does two things for web developers:
Provides a structural representation of the document
Defines the way that that structure is to be accessed from script
A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.
